# Long time, no release

Thanks to a contribution from @devlead, we are releasing 0.2.0 of Cake.CakeMail.  This includes the following:

## Improvement

- [__#4__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.CakeMail/issues/4) Switch away from using gep13.DefaultBuild and use Cake.Recipe instead

## Documentation

- [__#13__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.CakeMail/issues/13) Add Wyam Documentation generation

It was decided that this was required due to the fact that with the impending release of Cake 0.18.0 all addins need to be at least 0.16.0, so we decided to upload to the latest.

Please do not hesitate to reach out in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions/categories/extension-q-a) if you have any issues using this addin.
