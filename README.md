Cake.CakeMail is an Addin for [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) which allows sending of email via CakeMail.

## Usage

First, include a reference to this addin in your script like this:

```csharp
#addin nuget:?package=Cake.CakeMail&version=0.7.0&loaddependencies=true
```

Second, we highly recommend that you add the following 'using' statement in your script. Technically, this is not necessary, but it simplifies dealing with attachements:

```csharp
using Cake.Email.Common;
```

Also, this addin is designed to take advantage of some of the new features released in CakeBuild version `0.33.0` therefore your `tools\package.config` should look like this:

```xml
<packages>
    <package id="Cake" version="0.33.0" />
</packages>
```
